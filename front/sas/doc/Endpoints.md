# SimpleAnnotationServer endpoints

Below are a list of SAS endpoints but note they assume SAS is running as a root application. For the tomcat docker deployment you would need to add `/sas/` to the start of the URL. For example the create annotation endpoint would be:

```
/sas/annotation/create
```

# Search API endpoint (GET)
The endpoint for the IIIF Search implementation:

```
/search-api/_manifest_short_id/search
```

where `_manifest_short_id` is a URL safe nickname for the manifest. This is currently built in the following method:
